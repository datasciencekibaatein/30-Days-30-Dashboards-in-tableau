Welcome to the official repository of the **“30 Days 30 Dashboards”** Tableau challenge!

Over the course of 30 days, I designed **30 unique and interactive dashboards** using Tableau. This repository includes all Tableau workbook files (`.twb` / `.twbx`) and their corresponding datasets, so you can learn, practice, and get inspired.

## 🧠 About the Challenge

The **30 Days 30 Dashboards** initiative is a self-improvement and learning challenge where I built one dashboard each day to explore new data sets, apply visualization techniques, and master Tableau skills.

Each day covers:
- A new domain or industry
- Different types of data
- Fresh visual storytelling ideas
- Dashboard interactivity and UX enhancements
